    desc: 'In a feedback loop of adventure, music, and love, CloZee and her fans are ready to let the force of the sound carry everyone to places they have never been before. Being based simultaneously in Toulouse, France and on stages across the world makes this electronic musician stand out. With inspirations far afield from music – a painting, the weather, a dream – in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Clozee finds her best fit in World Bass’ corner.'

    desc: 'One of the most popular drum\'n\'bass acts of the early 21st century, Pendulum are an Australian group based in the United Kingdom. Formed in Perth in 2002, the group was originally comprised of producers Rob Swire and Gareth McGrillen, who worked in tandem with a local DJ named Paul "El Hornet" Harding. One of the team\'s initial releases, "Vault," became a sensation amid the drum\'n\'bass community in 2003, benefiting greatly from its high-profile placement at the beginning of J Majik\'s FabricLive mix album. The track was also licensed for placement on several other CDs, including Adam F and DJ Fresh\'s Breakbeat Kaos mix album for Ministry of Sound. Other early productions such as 2003\'s "Spiral" and 2004\'s "Another Planet" -- released by Adam F and DJ Fresh on their Breakbeat Kaos label -- were also well-received in the drum\'n\'bass community.'
